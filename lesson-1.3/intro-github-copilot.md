# Introduction to GitHub Copilot

Microsoft developed GitHub Copilot in collaboration with OpenAI. GitHub Copilot is powered by the OpenAI Codex system. OpenAI Codex has broad knowledge of how people use code and is more capable than GPT-3 in code generation. OpenAI Codex is more capable, in part, because it was trained on a dataset that included a larger concentration of public source code.

## GitHub Copilot features

Here are some features of GitHub Copilot that truly make it a developer tool of the future. With these features, GitHub Copilot is more than just an editor. It's becoming a readily accessible AI assistant throughout the entire development life cycle.

### Copilot for chat
GitHub Copilot brings a ChatGPT-like chat interface to the editor. The chat interface focuses on developer scenarios and natively integrates with VS Code and Visual Studio. It's deeply embedded in the IDE, and it recognizes what code a developer has typed and what error messages appear. A developer can get in-depth analysis and explanations of what code blocks are intended to do, generate unit tests, and even get proposed fixes to bugs.

### Copilot for pull requests
OpenAI's GPT-4 model adds support in GitHub Copilot for AI-powered tags in pull-request descriptions through a GitHub app that organization admins and individual repository owners can install. GitHub Copilot automatically fills out these tags based on the changed code. Developers can then review or modify the suggested descriptions.
