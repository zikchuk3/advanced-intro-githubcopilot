# Build a Website Using GitHub Copilot
In this exercise, you’ll use GitHub Copilot to create a basic webpage! We want to create a website that allows students to signup for additional coaching for our program. A few requirements we were given:

- Students should enter their basic information(Name, Email, etc.)
- Students must be able to see a list of multiple options they would like to request tutoring(Python Programming, Web Design, Startup Ideas, College Application, etc.)
- Students should be able to enter their preferred days and times for coaching

### Steps
1. You’ll first need to decide what your webpage should look like. You’ll want to keep it fairly simple for this first time. Some things to note:
    - Do some research on some similar websites for inspiration.
    - If you want to learn how people create wireframes of websites, check out this article by [Skillcrush: Website Wireframe 101](https://skillcrush.com/blog/website-wireframe/)


2. Next, you’ll need to sketch your webpage. There are different ways to do this, here are some options:
    - Draw your webpage on a piece of paper and then take a picture of it.
    - Draw your webpage on a phone or tablet if you have access to either and can download a drawing app.
    - You can use wireframe tools like [Wireframe(]https://wireframe.cc/) or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/#)
    - Don't spend too much time trying to make your sketch perfect, the idea is to truly have a quick sketch.
    - Upload your sketch.   In your Codespaces, right-click on lesson 1.3 folder, select Upload to upload your folder

3.  Create your UI in Home.html
    - Think about a prompt to generate code from your sketch.
    - Continue to refine until you get your initial sketch.

4.  If you noticed, maybe Copilot created everything in the home.html page.  
    - How can you make it better by creating some of the button click or other logic in python?
    - Continue to iterate on the design.  What additional functionality could you add to make it better?
    - What other things should you consider?

**When you are done, make sure to check-in code to your repository.(Hint - maybe Copilot could help you!)**
