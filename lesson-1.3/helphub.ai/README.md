# Build a Website Using GitHub Copilot
In this exercise, you‚Äôll use GitHub Copilot to create a **HelpHub.AI**, a smart support space for students! We want to create a website that allows students to signup for additional coaching for our program. A few requirements we were given:

- Students should enter their basic information(Name, Email, etc.)
- Students must be able to see a list of multiple options they would like to request tutoring(Python Programming, Web Design, Startup Ideas, College Application, etc.)
- Students should be able to enter their preferred days and times for coaching

### ‚úîÔ∏è Steps
1. You‚Äôll first need to decide what your webpage should look like. You‚Äôll want to keep it fairly simple for this first time. Some things to note:
    - Do some research on some similar websites for inspiration.
    - If you want to learn how people create wireframes of websites, check out this article by [Skillcrush: Website Wireframe 101](https://skillcrush.com/blog/website-wireframe/)


2. Next, you‚Äôll need to sketch your webpage. There are different ways to do this, here are some options:
    - Draw your webpage on a piece of paper and then take a picture of it.
    - Draw your webpage on a phone or tablet if you have access to either and can download a drawing app.
    - You can use wireframe tools like [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/) or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/#)
    - Don't spend too much time trying to make your sketch perfect, the idea is to truly have a quick sketch.
    - Upload your sketch.   In your Codespaces, right-click on lesson 1.3 folder, select Upload to upload your folder

3.  Create your UI in Home.html
    - Think about a prompt to generate code from your sketch.
    - Continue to refine until you get your initial sketch.

4.  If you noticed, maybe Copilot created everything in the home.html page.  
    - How can you make it better by creating some of the button click or other logic in python?
    - Continue to iterate on the design.  What additional functionality could you add to make it better?
    - What other things should you consider?

**When you are done, make sure to check-in code to your repository.(Hint - maybe Copilot could help you!)**

### üí™ Challenge Yourself
Now that you have your website up and running, add more features to make it ready for production.  Choose one of the 
| Feature | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Create an AI Chatbot | [Link](/lesson-1.3/helphub.ai/challenges/ai-chatbot.md)|
| Security Vulnerability Hunt & Fix | [Link](/lesson-1.3/helphub.ai/challenges/security-vulnerability.md) |


### üí° Pro-Tips
- Write clear Copilot prompts - Be specific about what you want
- Review generated code - Don't blindly accept suggestions
- Test frequently - Verify each step works before moving on
- Ask for explanations - Use Copilot Chat to understand code, ask it to explain what is going on and why it made the decisions it did.
- Iterate and improve - Refine your prompts based on results
