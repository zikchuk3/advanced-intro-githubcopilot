# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Complete the activity [here](https://igfnaqfcyl-13589482-i.codehs.me/index.html).  Then edit this page and write down your reflections here:

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
I felt like C performed best overall, but that is because it is my personal preference of receiving answers. It may not be as straightfoward as the others, but the extra information added a more in depth understanding. (example: in the first question when asked for the names, the others gave names and irrelevant context like where the planets are located beside Mars, but C gave where the names came from which connected with the original question).

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
The creativity section made the models most similar, and I can not really pick the most different one.

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
I was not that surprised, but I did like Model C a lot.

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
I'm not sure.
